# portfolio-2.0

As a coder you learn, you write crappy code, you learn some more, then you make something better than you did the first time. The learning never stops.

This is the second iteration of my portfolio site. This redesign came around in late 2011 - early 2012, not long after my [first portfolio](https://scrabill.github.io/) went live. I was started to "get" code and web design princples and had learned a lot on my own affter graduation. I still like this design, which is why it stuck around for so long, but its time for something new. 

My plan in 2017 is to phase out the static page and move it to be responsive and powered by Wordpress. In the meantime, I'm hosting my code here to make minor updates while practicing my version control skills.
